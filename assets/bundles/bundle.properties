block.esoterum-wire.name = Signal Wire
block.esoterum-wire.description = Used for basic signal transmission. Takes input from left, back, and right then outputs it to the front.

block.esoterum-junction.name = Signal Junction
block.esoterum-junction.description = Used for wire management, allows wires to intersect without interfering with eachother.

block.esoterum-router.name = Signal Router
block.esoterum-router.description = Splits input signal to every direction.

block.esoterum-node.name = Signal Node
block.esoterum-node.description = Transmits input signal to a linked node wirelessly, where it will output to all directions.

block.esoterum-latch.name = Data Latch
block.esoterum-latch.description = Used for storing signals. If back input is high, it will store signal input from left or right.

block.esoterum-controller.name = Signal Flow Controller
block.esoterum-controller.description = Each side can be configured as either input or output.

block.esoterum-switch.name = Signal Switch
block.esoterum-switch.description = Outputs a persistent signal when enabled, tap to toggle.

block.esoterum-button.name = Signal button
block.esoterum-button.description = Outputs a short signal pulse when tapped.

block.esoterum-AND.name = AND Gate
block.esoterum-AND.description = Outputs to front if both inputs are high.

block.esoterum-XOR.name = XOR Gate
block.esoterum-XOR.description = Outputs to front if only one input is high.

block.esoterum-NOT.name = NOT Gate
block.esoterum-NOT.description = Inverts signal input and outputs to front.
