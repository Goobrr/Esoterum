[h]Signal Wire

[i]esoterum-wire-fig1[t]Fig 1. Signal Wires in Action

A [accent]signal wire[] is used to transmit binary signals from its source to other locations, it is the most common component in circuitry.
Although more effective methods of signal transmission have developed, Corporate urges Engineers to use wires in situations where possible to cut on circuit weight and reduce cost.

[i]esoterum-wire-fig2[t]Fig 2. Signal Wire Inputs

The signal wire has three inputs: left, back and right. If any one of its inputs are high, it will output a high signal to the front.

Wires transmit signals almost instantly, with the only delay being in corners where quantum mechanics pose as a limitation.
