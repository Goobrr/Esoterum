[h]Basic Circuits

[n]I am putting this here to remind you that this section of the manual is condoned by the Corporation. There is nothing wrong with reading this section but according to worker guidelines we are not allowed to tamper with Corporate-sanctioned documents, and owning or copying this tampered manual violates said guideline.
However the I-0 Council did not seem to be bothered by this action. I have also discussed this with supervisors of other universes and my supervisor, we all agreed that it is fine.
So with that out of the way, i hope that this collection of circuits made by my colleagues and your fellow engineers may ease your journey in creation.
[accent]Good luck, Engineer.[][t]Sincerely, your supervisor.
