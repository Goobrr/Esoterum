[h]Signal Junction

[i]esoterum-junction-fig1[t]Fig 4.1. Signal Junction in Action

A [accent]signal junction[] is used where different signal wires, that must not connect, cross. The junction is commonly used in conjunction with signal routers to distribute data without mixing the signals.

The signal junction accepts input from any side and outputs to the opposite side. Thanks to improvements in the R&D department, signal junctions do not mix signals if two opposite sides are used as input.
