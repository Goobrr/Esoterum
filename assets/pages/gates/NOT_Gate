[h]NOT Gate

The [accent]NOT gate[] is 1 of the 3 fundamental gates made by the Esoterum Corporation. It is a pretty useful gate that inverts the signal. The NOT gates use a similar technology to signal switches, but in a manner that is inverted and controlled by an input signal. In fact, the signal switch in the NOT gate uses a second NOT gate to invert the signal. According to the R&D department, the explanation of this is because of quarks behaving weirdly without an internal NOT gate for the internal signal switch.

The NOT gate can be set to accept input from any side except the front. The inverted signal will then be outputted in the front.

[#4c4c4c] NOT gates are extremely complicated to produce, but cheap. A suggestion was made during meeting 0715-N78C to solve the fractal issue by using alternate timelines to invert the signals.
